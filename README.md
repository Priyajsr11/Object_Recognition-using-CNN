# Object_Recognition-using-CNN
--> Created a model that will detect a car in a live stream or video and recognize characters on number plate of the car .
--> Secondly , it will use the characters and fetch the owners information using RTO APIâ€™s . 
--> So basically I created a Web portal where all this information will be displayed (using html,css,and js).
